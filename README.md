This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying OpenIM v3.5 using Docker Compose. It covers all steps from preparing the environment to verifying the deployment.

> [!WARNING]
> Note that this guide is only applicable to OpenIM v3.5. If you want to use older versions, please refer to other `release-*` branches.

**Documentation**

+ [https://docs.openim.io/zh-Hans/guides/gettingStarted/dockerCompose](https://docs.openim.io/zh-Hans/guides/gettingStarted/dockerCompose)

##  1. <a name='EnvironmentPreparation'></a>Environment Preparation

- Ensure a clean server environment. For details, visit [OpenIM Environment Setup](https://www.notion.so/OpenIM-v3-5-Docker-Compose-9e94fc1fec3a4bc28c54db0c629301f8?pvs=21).
- Install Docker on the server.



##  2. <a name='OpenIMDockerUsageGuide'></a>OpenIM Docker Usage Guide

###  2.1. <a name='ProjectStructureExplanation'></a>Project Structure Explanation

\- For changes to `openim-server` and `openim-chat`, please contribute separately at https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/ and https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/chat.

\- To synchronize scripts and configuration files of the two projects, we use automation tools. Just ensure that the files are synchronized with the original repository.

\- For environment variable files and Docker-compose examples, make changes under `env/` and `example/`.

###  2.2. <a name='ObtaintheImage'></a>Obtain the Image

You can get the Docker image from the following three sources:

- [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/OpenIMSDK/packages?repo_name=Open-IM-Server)
- Alibaba Cloud
- Docker Hub

To ensure you get the latest version of the image, please refer to the following documents:

- [OpenIM Version Design](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/blob/main/docs/conversions/version.md)
- [OpenIM Image Strategy](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/blob/main/docs/conversions/images.md)



##  3. <a name='RepositorySetup'></a>Repository Setup

Clone the repository and select the appropriate branch:

```bash
git clone -b refactor/openim-docker https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker openim-docker && cd openim-docker && make init
```

##  4. <a name='BasicConfiguration'></a>Basic Configuration

- Use `curl http://ifconfig.me` to determine your external service IP.
- Set your IP address in the environment:

```bash
export OPENIM_IP="Your IP Address"
```

- If you forget this step, refer to [Configuration File Modification](#Configuration File Modification) later.

##  5. <a name='AdvancedConfiguration'></a>Advanced Configuration

For complex configurations:

- Copy the `.env` file and perform necessary configurations using `make init`.
- Refer to the [OpenIM Server Environment Documentation](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/blob/main/docs/contrib/environment.md) for detailed guidance.

##  6. <a name='ConfigurationReadingPriority'></a>Configuration Reading Priority

The highest priority is values read from environment variables, followed by values in the `.env` file, and lastly, default values in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

##  7. <a name='StartingtheService'></a>Starting the Service

- Start the OpenIM service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

##  8. <a name='Verification'></a>Verification

- **OpenIM Server:** Check logs with `docker compose logs -f openim-server`.
- **OpenIM Chat:** Validate logs with `docker compose logs -f openim-chat`.
- **OpenIM Web:** Visit http://127.0.0.1:11001, register, and verify sending pictures and text between accounts.
- **OpenIM Management:** Visit https://127.0.0.1:11002, use the default credentials `admin1, admin1`.

##  10. <a name='Deployingwithexample'></a>Deploying with example

Note that if deploying using example, the `DATA_DIR` variable needs to be set to specify the location for data storage.

```bash
export DATA_DIR="/test/test"
```

`DATA_DIR` will store configuration information, data, and logs for middleware, as well as configuration information and logs for openim-server and openim-chat.

For example, when deploying openim-server, openim-chat, openim-admin, and openim-web, use:

```bash
docker-compose -f example/full-openim-server-chat-web-admin.yml up -d 
```

To check the logs:

```bash
docker-compose -f example/full-openim-server-chat-web-admin.yml logs -f openim-server
docker-compose -f example/full-openim-server-chat-web-admin.yml logs -f openim-chat
```

To check the data storage location:

```bash
cat example/.env |grep DATA_DIR
```

To clear data:

```bash
docker-compose -f example/full-openim-server-chat-web-admin.yml down
rm -rf "Data Storage Location"
```

**Directory Structure:**

```bash
$ tree /test/ -L 3
/test/
└── test
    ├── components
    │   ├── kafka
    │   ├── mnt
    │   ├── mongodb
    │   ├── mysql
    │   └── redis
    └── openim-server
    │   ├── config
    │   ├── logs
    │   └── _output
    │
    └── openim-chat
        ├── config
        └── logs
```

##  11. <a name='ConfigurationFileModification'></a>Configuration File Modification

Before modifying the configuration file, use `docker compose down` to stop the service.

- To modify the configuration, mainly focus on the `.env` file.
- Use `make init` to initialize the configuration file.
- In Docker, for shared variables in `.env`, `openim-server/config/config.yaml`, and `openim-chat/config/config.yaml`, follow steps for completely regenerating configuration or partial updates.
- For specific updates such as `OPENIM_IP`, `API_OPENIM_PORT`, `MINIO_PORT`, etc., ensure they are updated in `openim-server/config/config.yaml`.

```bash
object:
  apiURL: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$API_OPENIM_PORT"
  minio:
    endpoint: "http://$DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY:$MINIO_PORT"
    signEndpoint: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$MINIO_PORT"

grafanaUrl: http://$OPENIM_IP:$GRAFANA_PORT
```

##  12. <a name='CommonConfigurations'></a>Common Configurations

- Set `OPENIM_IP`, `DATA_DIR`, and `IMAGE_REGISTRY` according to your needs.
- For database configurations like MySQL, Redis, Kafka, MongoDB, MinIO, and Zookeeper, update the respective ports and credentials.

##  13. <a name='OpenIMDockerUpgrade'></a>OpenIM Docker Upgrade

- Upgrading from V3.4 to V3.5 involves code changes and deployment structure reconfiguration, currently not supporting automatic upgrades.
- For minor updates (and those after v3.5), which do not involve adding or removing configuration files, modify `SERVER_IMAGE_VERSION` and `CHAT_IMAGE_VERSION` in the `.env` file.
- Use `git pull` and `make upgrade` to update the repository.

##  14. <a name='CleaningUpDeployment'></a>Cleaning Up Deployment

- Use `docker compose down` to stop the service.
- Use `sudo make clean` to clean up configurations.
- Optionally clean data and prune unused networks: `docker network prune -f`

##  15. <a name='AdditionalInformation'></a>Additional Information

- Ensure the IP and port environment variables for chat are consistent.
- For quick verification, management backend, monitoring system, and more detailed configuration instructions, refer to the OpenIM documentation.

##  16. <a name='CommonIssues'></a>Common Issues

+ The new version of Docker integrates `docker-compose`. Older versions may not support the gateway feature. It's recommended to upgrade to a newer version, such as 23.0.1.
