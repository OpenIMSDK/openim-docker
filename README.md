# OpenIM Docker Deployment

OpenIM Docker offers a stable solution for building and deploying OpenIM. There are many deployment options available, and the process is simplified using Docker and Docker Compose.

- `build/`: For building Docker images.
- `openim-server/`: For deploying openim-server.
- `openim-chat/`: For deploying openim-chat.
- `env/`: Contains environment variable files for Docker-compose. (Not needed for now)
- `example/`: Contains various Docker-compose examples, offering feature deployment schemes.

### Project Structure Explanation

- For changes to `openim-server` and `openim-chat`, please contribute separately at https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/ and https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/chat.
- To synchronize scripts and configuration files of the two projects, we use automation tools. Just ensure that the files are synchronized with the original repository.
- For environment variable files and Docker-compose examples, make changes under `env/` and `example/`.

## How to Use OpenIM Docker

#### 1. Get the Image

You can get the Docker image from three sources:

- [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/OpenIMSDK/packages?repo_name=Open-IM-Server)
- Alibaba Cloud
- Docker Hub

To ensure you get the latest version of the image, refer to the following documents:

- [OpenIM version design](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/blob/main/docs/conversions/version.md)
- [OpenIM image strategy](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/blob/main/docs/conversions/images.md)

#### 2. Using Docker-compose

**Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/openim-sigs/openim-docker openim/openim-docker && export openim=$(pwd)/openim && cd $openim/openim-docker
```

**Modify the configuration files:**

Three ways to modify the configuration:

1. Recommended using environment variables:

```bash
export PASSWORD="openIM123" # Set password
export USER="root" # Set username
# Choose chat version and server version https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/blob/main/docs/conversions/images.md, eg: main, release-v*.*
export CHAT_BRANCH="main"
export SERVER_BRANCH="main"
#... Other environment variables
# MONGO_USERNAME: This sets the MongoDB username
# MONGO_PASSWORD: Set the MongoDB password
# MONGO_DATABASE: Sets the MongoDB database name
# MINIO_ENDPOINT: set the MinIO service address
# API_URL: under network environment, set OpenIM Server API address
export API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:10002"
```

Because `openim-server:v3.2` has some incompatible file, so, if you want to use `openim-server:v3.2`, so please use the following command to deploy:

```bash
git clone -b release-v1.2 https://github.com/openim-sigs/openim-docker openim/openim-docker && export openim=$(pwd)/openim && cd $openim/openim-docker && export CHAT_BRANCH="release-v1.2" && export SERVER_BRANCH="release-v3.2" &&  $openim/openim-docker/scripts/init-config.sh && docker-compose up -d
```

Next, update the configuration using `make init`:

```
make init
```

2. Modify the automation script:

```
scripts/install/environment.sh
```

3. Modify `config.yaml` and `.env` files (but will be overwritten when using `make init` again).

**Default start option:**

```
docker-compose up -d

# Or use make:
make install
```

**examine：**
```bash
make check
```


> **Note**: If image pulling is slow, you can choose the image from AliCloud. Both openim-server and openim-chat use the same image, just modify the image in the docker-compose.yml.

```
# image: ghcr.io/openimsdk/openim-server:latest
image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/openimsdk/openim-server:latest
# image: openim/openim-server:latest
```

**Custom Start-Up**

Based on your requirements, choose the appropriate Docker-compose file to start:

- **Basic Environment Dependency**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose -f example/basic-openim-server-dependency.yml up -d
  ```

- **Only OpenIM Server**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose -f example/only-openim-server.yml up -d
  ```

- **Both OpenIM Server and Chat**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose -f example/full-openim-server-and-chat.yml up -d
  ```

**Mounting:**

In the Docker Compose file, the "volumes" keyword defines named volumes. Named volumes are a storage concept in Docker that allows you to create persistent storage for a container. This means that even if the container is deleted, the data stored on that volume will not be lost.

For easy management, we use named volumes. These volumes have the same name as the services. For instance, the openim-server service uses the openim-server named volume, and the openim-chat service uses the openim-chat named volume.

View all volumes:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

View a specific volume:

```bash
docker volume inspect <volume-name>
```

Delete a named volume:

```bash
docker volume rm <volume-name>
```

Delete unused volumes:

```bash
docker volume prune
```

**Customizing Your Image**

For easy customization, we provide basic images of various distributions and architectures. The repository address is https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/openim-base-image, for easy customization.

**Test Running Status**

To see if all services have started, you can use:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

If you find a container that hasn't started, you can view the logs of the specific service to find out the reason. For example, to view the logs of OpenIM Server:

```bash
docker-compose logs openim-server
```

**Stop**

To stop all services running by Docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

If you used a specific `docker-compose` file, make sure to specify it in the `down` command as well.

#### 3. Tips

Ensure your Docker and Docker Compose are up-to-date to guarantee the best compatibility and performance.
